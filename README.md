## About The Project

The project is about an App where users will be able to filter and find most suitable backpacks for their needs. In this initial version, there's a simple card list of items that can be filtered through the top search input. The search is based in the names so far.

I've develop the simplest solution using some rxJs operators that came up to my mind that could be useful. The project's goal is to discuss the problematics and scenarios using observables and subjects.
